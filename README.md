# Iris Classifier with  100% accuracy


## About data:
The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

The three classes in the Iris dataset:

    Iris-setosa (n=50)
    Iris-versicolor (n=50)
    Iris-virginica (n=50)

The four features of the Iris dataset:

    sepal length in cm
    sepal width in cm
    petal length in cm
    petal width in cm
    
    


## Overview

Code for EDA and A SVM model that classifies flower specie with 100% accuracy. We first converge the model to highest accuracy and then apply sklearn's grid search to find the best hyperparameter for our SVM. Following this we achieve 100% accuracy on our predictions.
